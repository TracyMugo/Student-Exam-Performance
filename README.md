# Predicting Student Exam Performance

This project uses machine learning to predict students’ final math exam scores (G3) using the Student Performance Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to identify patterns and factors that influence student performance and to accurately predict final exam results.

## Dataset
#theresia michaels
- Name: Student Performance Data Set
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- File used: `student-mat.csv`
- Target variable: G3 (Final exam grade)

## Process Overview
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Loaded the dataset and handled missing values (if any).
2. **Feature Selection:** Removed irrelevant columns and selected features that influence exam performance.
3. **Model Training:** Trained two machine learning models:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
4. **Model Evaluation:** Used metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score to evaluate model performance.
5. **Prediction:** Compared predictions to actual values to assess model accuracy.

## Results Summary
| Metric       | Linear Regression | Decision Tree |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| MAE          | [Insert MAE]      | [Insert MAE]   |
| RMSE         | [Insert RMSE]     | [Insert RMSE]  |
| R² Score     | [Insert R2]       | [Insert R2]    |

(*Replace the bracketed values with your actual evaluation results.*)

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualizations)
